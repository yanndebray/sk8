# Container image for the sk8 MCP server.
# Works on Cloud Run, AWS App Runner, Fly.io, Fargate, or any container host.
# Reads three env vars at runtime:
#   PORT               - listen port (managed platforms inject this; default 8080)
#   AGENT_TOKEN        - shared bearer token gating /mcp (required)
#   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY  - the box's Claude Code credential / billing identity (required)
#
# Build arg:
#   PROFILE  - path (relative to build context) to the agent profile baked into
#              the image: extra Python deps, skills, and a tool/system-prompt
#              spec. Defaults to the empty `profiles/default` so a plain build
#              behaves exactly as an un-customized agent. A profile build passes
#              e.g. --build-arg PROFILE=profiles/data-analyst (see cloudbuild.yaml).
